## Implementation Tasks

### Slice 1 — Solution skeleton and pure contracts

- [x] Create the .NET 8 WPF solution and test projects at the repository root, targeting x64 Windows 10/11 and keeping domain/application projects free of WPF, HTTP, filesystem, and SQLite dependencies.
- [x] Add domain records and ports under the chosen project structure for `QuotaSnapshot`, freshness/state, scan coverage, token deltas, daily usage, pricing results, and the contracts listed in `design.md` (`ICodexCredentialSource`, `IQuotaProvider`, stores, scanner, startup, clock/time policy).
- [x] Add deterministic clock/time-policy primitives and the error taxonomy needed to distinguish authentication, permission, malformed response, network, service, unavailable, stale, and partial-coverage states.
- [x] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** add pure tests for freshness transitions, service-reset countdown basis, component-wise non-negative deltas, and immutable/source-distinct data types; make them pass and refactor without introducing infrastructure coupling.
- [x] Verify `dotnet build` and all tests pass with the private adapter disabled and no real Codex files, credentials, or network calls.

**Acceptance evidence:** solution/build output, unit-test report, and dependency inspection showing the domain has no platform or persistence references. Rollback is removal of the skeleton projects without touching user data.

### Slice 2 — Credential discovery and private quota adapter

- [ ] Implement the single supported Codex-root resolver (`%CODEX_HOME%`, otherwise the current-user `.codex` root) and a read-only minimum-field credential reader; never deserialize, persist, or log refresh tokens, passwords, browser cookies, prompt/response content, or unrelated secret fields.
- [ ] Implement the feature-gated `IQuotaProvider` using `HttpClient`, HTTPS origin allowlisting for `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`, redirects disabled, cancellation/timeouts, bounded retry rules, and request-scoped credential lifetime.
- [ ] Implement version-neutral response DTO mapping for `/wham/usage` and optional `/wham/rate-limit-reset-credits`, validating required percentages/reset times and preserving optional-detail failure independently.
- [ ] Classify 401/403/429/5xx, transport/timeout, malformed/missing-field, and unavailable cases into safe error codes without raw bodies, headers, credentials, or sensitive account identifiers.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** add fixture/contract tests for minimum/extra/malformed auth fields, valid and schema-drift responses, status classes, redirect rejection, retry limits, optional-detail failure, and secret-free errors.
- [ ] Add the explicit unsupported/private-endpoint disclosure and a build/application setting that can disable this integration without disabling local analytics.

**Acceptance evidence:** adapter contract test report, redaction assertions, and a captured configuration showing the feature disabled by default. Rollback is disabling/removing the adapter while retaining local analytics contracts. Requires focused `review-risk`.

### Slice 3 — Refresh coordination and quota cache

- [ ] Implement `QuotaRefreshCoordinator` with cache-first publication, one in-flight refresh task, trigger coalescing, manual-refresh freshness bypass, conservative polling, cancellation, sleep/resume and clock-change re-evaluation.
- [ ] Implement SQLite schema/migration and `IQuotaSnapshotStore` for normalized quota fields and retrieval metadata only; atomically commit successful primary snapshots and never store credentials or raw responses.
- [ ] Preserve the prior snapshot and original timestamp on failure, overlay the classified error, and transition to explicit stale/unavailable states after the documented freshness threshold; optional-detail failures must not erase primary data.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** add coordinator/store tests for startup cache rendering, concurrent triggers, manual bypass, stale-on-failure, atomic save/load, cancellation races, clear-data publication, and optional-detail degradation.
- [ ] Verify migration, foreign keys, WAL configuration, and crash-before-commit behavior using persistence integration tests.

**Acceptance evidence:** coordinator and persistence test report plus database inspection proving only normalized cache data exists. Rollback is a schema-compatible removal of the cache feature; no destructive downgrade or Codex-file mutation.

### Slice 4 — Native tray, popover, and quota presentation

- [ ] Implement the single-process WPF host, named-mutex single-instance activation, tray recreation handling, taskbar/DPI-aware borderless popover positioning, deactivation behavior, and explicit Exit command that cancels work and closes persistence.
- [ ] Implement immutable view models/state rendering for current, stale, loading, unavailable, authentication, permission, malformed, network, and service states; never show a fabricated percentage or stale data as current.
- [ ] Build the custom semantic WPF design tokens and compact CodexBar-inspired quota cards using Windows-native typography, spacing, contrast, keyboard navigation, visible focus, accessible names, reduced-motion behavior, high-contrast support, and DPI scaling.
- [ ] Show independent 5-hour/weekly percentages, service reset countdowns, source/timestamp/freshness disclosure, manual refresh, local-analytics separation, estimated-cost separation, and private-endpoint disclosure.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** test view-model state mapping and coordinator/UI command behavior; add focused Windows smoke checks for tray toggling, popover focus, single-instance activation, taskbar recreation, and representative DPI.
- [ ] Capture representative Windows 10/11 visual evidence; treat accessibility and lifecycle checks as acceptance evidence, not screenshot similarity alone.

**Acceptance evidence:** view-model tests, Windows smoke results, accessibility checklist, and W10/W11 screenshots at representative scale factors. Rollback is removal of presentation while preserving application services.

### Slice 5 — Incremental scanner and checkpointing

- [ ] Implement supported initial Codex `sessions` and `archived_sessions` discovery only, with bounded background batches and cancellation.
- [ ] Implement streaming JSONL parsing from validated checkpoints, file identity/size/mtime comparison, append handling, incomplete-tail deferral, parser-semantics invalidation, replacement/rebuild, and transactional checkpoint updates.
- [ ] Parse only timestamps, trustworthy model evidence, and token counters; skip/defer malformed or changing records with scan coverage warnings and never retain prompt/response bodies.
- [ ] Implement `scan_run` provenance/status including discovered/read/skipped/deferred counts, warnings, cancellation, and partial coverage.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** add synthetic golden/property tests for unchanged rescans, appended events, malformed/truncated files, replaced/shrunk files, cumulative resets, cancellation, parser-version invalidation, idempotence, and non-negative deltas.
- [ ] Verify fixture data contains no real credentials, paths, prompt text, or response text, and that cancellation before commit leaves aggregates/checkpoints unchanged.

**Acceptance evidence:** scanner golden/property and persistence test reports with coverage warnings. Rollback is disabling scanning; existing committed aggregates remain readable. Requires focused `review-reliability`.

### Slice 6 — Daily aggregation, model attribution, and clear-data isolation

- [ ] Implement transactional `daily_model_usage` aggregation for input, cached-input, and output totals using `max(0, current - previous)` per component and the exact documented ranking formula `total tokens = input + cached input + output`.
- [ ] Implement explicit `Unknown` attribution for missing/untrusted model evidence; never infer a named model or rank by cost.
- [ ] Implement Windows local-timezone/day normalization with timezone ID, observed offset, DST behavior, UTC-derived provenance, and explicit rebuild/version behavior when the policy changes.
- [ ] Add SQLite migrations and transactional tests for checkpoint/aggregate atomicity, crash recovery, repricing without token mutation, and aggregate retention.
- [ ] Implement Clear AIBar Data to cancel work, remove only AIBar-owned cache/database/log/settings data, recreate empty state, and prove Codex-owned source files are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** test model ranking, `Unknown`, midnight/DST boundaries, reset/decrease handling, clear-data isolation, and partial scan retention.

**Acceptance evidence:** aggregation/property/persistence/privacy test reports and before/after hashes of Codex fixtures. Rollback is a schema-compatible disablement of derived analytics; source files are never deleted.

### Slice 7 — Pricing, trends, pace, burn, and ETA

- [ ] Add a checked-in, versioned immutable pricing catalog with version/date provenance, component-specific rates, unsupported-model results, and no fallback rate for `Unknown`.
- [ ] Implement estimated-cost calculation and UI labels/warnings for estimate status, unknown models, repricing, discounts, routing, contracts, and non-authoritative billing assumptions; never use billed-cost/invoice/credit language.
- [ ] Implement named daily trend windows (initial 7 complete local days and day-over-day comparison) and simple linear quota exhaustion from observed current-window usage, remaining service quota, reset time, and valid positive rate only.
- [ ] Return insufficient/unavailable for stale quota, invalid reset, zero/negative rate, insufficient observations, or unsupported forecasting; never reconstruct hourly history or emit probabilistic predictions.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** test pricing provenance/warnings, model totals, trend windows, time basis, ETA insufficiency, and linear estimate labeling.
- [ ] Verify UI/source labels distinguish service quota, locally derived analytics, and estimated cost in view-model snapshots.

**Acceptance evidence:** domain/UI tests and sample output showing formula, window, rate basis, provenance, and warnings. Rollback is removal of derived metrics without changing token facts or quota behavior.

### Slice 8 — Startup, diagnostics, packaging, privacy, and compatibility hardening

- [ ] Implement per-user startup registration abstraction: packaged startup-task path where available and unpackaged HKCU Run entry with quoted executable and `--startup`; read back effective state after mutation, never elevate or write machine-wide state.
- [ ] Add native commands/settings for startup toggle, Clear AIBar Data, safe diagnostic export, and private-integration disablement; keep telemetry and remote crash reporting off by default.
- [ ] Implement central redaction before every diagnostic sink/export for bearer headers, secret fields, sensitive IDs, URLs/query strings, paths, raw bodies, auth files, JSONL lines, database rows, and exception values; bound local log size/age.
- [ ] Add privacy tests that recursively inspect AIBar-owned persistence, logs, diagnostics, exports, and UI/error snapshots for seeded prompt/response text, bearer values, sensitive IDs, and source paths.
- [ ] Add deterministic x64 Windows 10/11 packaging, SBOM, signed per-user MSIX path when signing is available, unpackaged self-contained development/recovery artifact, and upgrade/migration/uninstall/user-data retention checks.
- [ ] **RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR:** add packaging smoke tests for clean install, upgrade, startup launch, single instance, uninstall, and data retention/removal; perform W10/W11 manual/VM checks for tray recreation, DPI, taskbar placement, sleep/resume, popover focus, and concrete unsupported behavior.
- [ ] Complete policy/legal review, dependency and source-provenance/MIT-notice review, private-endpoint compatibility validation, and remote-free kill-switch verification before enabling distribution builds.

**Acceptance evidence:** packaging artifacts/checksums/SBOM, install-upgrade-uninstall report, W10/W11 matrix, privacy inspection report, policy/legal sign-off, and rollback procedure. Requires focused `review-resilience` plus release risk review.

## Cross-Slice Completion Gates

- [ ] Run the full test suite, static analysis, dependency/license checks, and `dotnet publish` for the supported Windows target.
- [ ] Confirm all MVP non-goals remain unsupported and no code path reads multiple roots/accounts, WSL, browser cookies, passwords, prompt/response bodies, or authoritative billing data.
- [ ] Confirm generated fixtures and screenshots are synthetic/approved and remain bound to the reviewed behavior.
- [ ] Confirm each implementation slice remains independently revertible and its authored change count is at or below 400 lines before opening or advancing its chained PR.
- [ ] Preserve no credentials or user content in test evidence, logs, artifacts, screenshots, or release bundles.
